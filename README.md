# Neutron

This is basically a clone of [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate).

I wanted to learn more about the webpack/babel/electron build process so I built
it from scratch. They may differ and I may ultimately use that one, but this was
a good learning process.
